# Mapping_Earthquakes

Creating interactive maps using Leaflet.js, Javascript, D3.js, Mapbox and HTML to create an interactive map with geoJSON earthquake data

## Overview 

In phase 1 of this project we created an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay.  For this phase we have been tasked with add ing earthquake data in realtion to the tectonic plates' location on the earth using earthquake data for earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map and then to see that data on a third map.

Requested Deliverables are as Follows:

 * **Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data**
 * **Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data for earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5**
 * **Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
